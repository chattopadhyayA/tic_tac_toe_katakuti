# tic_tac_toe_katakuti
This is a simple-minded AI eager to play katakuti with you. The name katakuti is a bengali(language) alias for the game tic-tac-toe. Please enjoy and let me know your complaints/thoughts to me 
## Version Info
Currently the project is at version 0. In future we are planning the following
- A time prompt to get a time dependent game
- An improved version of the AI replacing the current simple minded one
- A menu item to **change the history of the game**

## Game Play
The rules are the usual ones. The board is set to be in classic 3X3 format. But this can be changed easily by changing the value of the variable **BOARD_SIZE** variable.

## File Generation
This code generates a hidden folder named **Game_Data** to store the weights of the neural network as well as the game play history.

## Requirements
This game imports the following special packages, most of them come by default with python3 and tensorflow installation
'''
import tkinter
import itertools
import typing
import tensorflow
import numpy
import time, os, sys
import csv
import pandas
'''

## Distribution
If interesting, please feel free to modify/distribute the code and let me know for improvements/suggestion.
